[COMMENT spheretables]
NOTE: This file is loaded 2nd after SPHERE.INI and the order is very important,
so be aware that the resources section is processed top down... if a file near
the top is dependant on a file near the bottom, you may try to slide the dependent
file up the list... but sometimes unreconcilable dependencies can happen, in which
case the problematic file may need to be split.

As a general rule:
- DEFNAMEs come first
- TYPEDEF and EVENTS second
- ITEMDEF and CHARDEF
- REGION* comes before AREADEF and ROOMDEF
- TEMPLATE last
